Sentence Boundary Detection (SBD)
=================================

Split text into sentences with a `vanilla` rule based approach (i.e working ~95% of the time).

* Split a text based on period, question- and exclamation marks.
    * Skips (most) abbreviations (Mr., Mrs., PhD.)
    * Skips numbers/currency
    * Skips urls, websites, email addresses, phone nr.
    * Counts ellipsis and ?! as single punctuation

## Installation

Use [npm](http://npmjs.org) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/):

    $ npm install sbd

    $ yarn add sbd


## How to

```javascript
var tokenizer = require('sbd');

var optional_options = {};
var text = "On Jan. 20, former Sen. Barack Obama became the 44th President of the U.S. Millions attended the Inauguration.";
var sentences = tokenizer.sentences(text, optional_options);

// [
//  'On Jan. 20, former Sen. Barack Obama became the 44th President of the U.S.',
//  'Millions attended the Inauguration.',
// ]
```


#### Optional options

```
var options = {
    "newline_boundaries" : false,
    "html_boundaries"    : false,
    "sanitize"           : false,
    "allowed_tags"       : false,
    "preserve_whitespace" : false,
    "abbreviations"      : null
};
```

* `newline_boundaries`, force sentence split at newlines
* `html_boundaries`, force sentence split at specific tags (br, and closing p, div, ul, ol)
* `sanitize`: If you don't expect nor want html in your text.
* `allowed_tags`: To sanitize html, the library [santize-html](https://github.com/punkave/sanitize-html) is used. You can pass the allowed tags option.
* `preserve_whitespace`: Preserve the literal whitespace between words and sentences (otherwise, internal spaces are normalized to a single space char, and inter-sentence whitespace is omitted). Preserve whitespace has no effect if either newline_boundaries or html_boundaries is specified.
* `abbreviations`: list of abbreviations to override the original ones for use with other languages. Don't put dots in your custom abbreviations.
